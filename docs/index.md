# PokeClone Documentation

Welcome to the PokeClone docs. This site focuses on **exhaustive, code-accurate UI behavior**: every button, tool, and shortcut is listed by screen.

## Where to start

- If you just want to run tools, start with **Getting Started**.
- If you need control reference, go to **Main Menu**, **Pixel Art Editor**, **Move Animation Editor**, **Map Editor**, **Battle Simulator**, and **Overworld**.
- If you want current combat tuning details, read **Balance Pass (2026-02)**.
- Design documents live under **Design Docs**.

## Scope note

The control lists in this documentation are derived from the current code. If a control in the README differs from what is listed here, treat this documentation as the source of truth.
